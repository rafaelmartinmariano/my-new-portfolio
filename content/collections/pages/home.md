    about_me: |-
      I specialize in building modern, responsive, and user-focused web applications. With a deep passion for solving real-world problems through clean code and intuitive design, I love turning ideas into functional digital experiences. Whether it's front-end interfaces, back-end logic, or full-stack solutions, I enjoy every part of the development process.

      Driven by curiosity and constant learning, I explore new tools, frameworks, and technologies to stay ahead in the fast-paced tech world. From optimizing performance to crafting seamless user experiences, I aim to create work that is not only efficient—but meaningful.

      When I’m not coding, I’m either exploring new tech, reading about innovations, or quietly building something new from scratch.
